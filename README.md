# Event Platform :sparkles:
It's a platform where have lessons about how to build the project. It's crazy, seems like a "inception", i think that really is. Very cool project where i've learned a lot about React and others techs.

Project created at event 'Ignite Lab' from [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

## About

A platform where you can subscribe to the event and then redirected to the main page.

How i said, it's a "inception" because the lessons are the project by himself.
